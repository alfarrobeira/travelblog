                    <p>First time on the island. I arrived yesterday. Today I am going on my first hike. And what can I tell you?
                        I fell in love with the island right away. Came as a complete surprise. I hadn't expected anything,
                        just wanted to spend my remaining vacation days anyplace warmer than in Germany and a friend had told me, Madeira was good for hiking.<br>
                        So here I am, standing at the north-eastern most part of Madeira, at the Ponta de S&atilde;o Louren&ccedil;o.
                        Looking at this beautiful landscape, the cliffs, the ocean, feeling the fresh breeze, breathing deeply and suddenly thinking:
                        This is the perfect place: combination of sea and mountains. This is where I want to be for retirement. Maybe earlier...</p>

                    <p>Madeira at its best. Another wonderful day in paradise: 20 degrees, blue sky, warm sun.<br>
                        Today I joined a group to go to the highest peaks of the islands and hiked from Pico do Areeiro to Pico Ruivo. 
                        I cannot describe the feeling when standing at 1860m above sea level and 360Â° around you can still see the ocean. 
                        It's magestic! Difficult to stop smiling ;-)<br>
                        The hike itself wasn't easy, but absolutely doable: approx. 8km and 600m in altitude.</p>
